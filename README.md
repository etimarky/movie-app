# movie-app
```
This project creates a web page that will display a list of movies that stream on Netflix. This project uses Vue.cli as well as a router. Various components will be created to further enhance the user experience. Currently, the project has been completed thus far but there are many additional changes that can be made. 

Run this project along with the github https://github.com/etimarky/movie-library and a database with the approx. rest API data. The Movie App will be fully functioning. 

The movie app currently has a wish list on the home page. This connects to an array called selected. Currently, if something is selected it is added to the db table 'select'. If I could make more improvements, I would load 'select' into wish list so the wish list can be saved everytime and then load the Movie App with the correct wish list each time.

The rest API used is from https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/.
